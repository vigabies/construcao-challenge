<h3>Context:</h3>
You work as an analyst/programmer at a software company and have been tasked with creating an application to calculate the volume of concrete for beams in construction. The formula for calculating this volume is (base x height x length).

<h3>Tasks:</h3>
<li>Your task is to implement this application in an object-oriented programming (OOP) language and to use encapsulation techniques.</li>
